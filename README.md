# SGMakan 🍜

A personal food discovery platform for Singapore's best food spots. Always finding new food places is difficult, so I built this project to maintain an updated list of favorite spots that I can share with friends.

## About

This project was born out of the frustration of constantly searching for new food spots in Singapore. Instead of relying on scattered recommendations, SGMakan provides a curated, personal list of cafes and restaurants that gets updated regularly. It's designed to be shared with friends, making it easy to discover and recommend great places to eat.

This is also an experimental project to learn and work with [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/) for backend functionality.
